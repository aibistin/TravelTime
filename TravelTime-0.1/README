NAME
    TravelTime - Calculate fixed travel times for Commercial Moving Truck

VERSION
    version 0.1

SYNOPSIS
  _get_google_itinerary_data
   Call the google matrix with the user supplied addresses.
   Return an array containing Google data for each address combination.
  _create_itinerary
  Create an array of each address in the order of the itinerary.
  The address will be in HashRef format.
  For simplicity only the first address will be treated as an "origin"
  address. All other addresses will be treated as destination addresses.
  _get_google_travel_matrix
 Create  a Google::Travel::Matrix object.
 This is our interface with the Google Travel Matrix API.
 Returns a Google::Travel::Matrix object.
  _get_google_matrix_data
  Get distances from the Google matrix.
  Pass the Google::Travel::Matrix object and an array containing
  the Origination address as well as the destination address.
  For simplicity only the first address will be treated as an "origin"
  address. All other addresses will be treated as destination addresses.
    Returns an array of HashRefs.... [ { origin_address => $origin_address,
    destination_address => $destination_address, element_status =>
    $element_status, element_duration_text => $element_duration_text,
    element_duration_value => $element_duration_value, element_distance_text
    => $element_distance_text, #------ This distance is ALWAYS in Meters.
    element_distance_value => $element_distance_value, distance_in_miles =>
    sub { calculate distance in miles }, }, {}, ]

  _get_all_itinerary_data
  Get the iteinerary data from Google::Travel::Matrix
  Get Mover Travel Time For each "From" "To" address combination.
  Add it to each HashRef of Google::Travel::Matrix results.
  Return an array with HashRefs of all itinerary data for each "To"/"From"
  address element.
      @all_itinerary_data =
      [
        (
        %google_matrix_result,
        mover_travel_time_minutes => sub{ #calculate mover travel time},
        mover_travel_time => {
                hours         => int( $minutes / 60 ),
                minutes       => $minutes % 60,
                hours_minutes => $minutes / 60,
            },
        ), 
        (
        %google_matrix_result,
        mover_travel_time_minutes => sub{},
        mover_travel_time => {},
        ), 
        ..... 
      ]

  _convert_miles_to_travel_time
 Uses this method:
    The first 20 miles is 60 minutes.
    Each 10 miles after that is 15 mins
    Note:  
        15 minutes is the smallest time unit.
        The given milage is converted to an integer, therefore removing any fractions.
        This integer milage is rounded up to next highest 10 miles.
